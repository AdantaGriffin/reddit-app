README



* 		Project Title: the name of your project
* 		Description: This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.
* 		Features: If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.
* 		How to use: Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.
* 		Technologies: List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.
* 		Collaborators: If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.
* 		License: It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use this guide to help you choose a license.







# RedditApp
Code Academy: Reddit App Challenge Project
## Overview
React and Redux. Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.
---
## Project Requirements:
- Build the application using React and Redux

- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub

- Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work

- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
   - Wireframes
   - Technologies used
   - Features
   - Future work
- Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme

- Write end-to-end tests for your application

- Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)

- Users can use the application on any modern browser

- Users can access your application at a URL

- Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app

- Users can search the data using terms

- Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined

- Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item

- Users are delighted with a cohesive design system

- Users are delighted with animations and transitions

- Users are able to leave an error state

- Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse

   - We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
- OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application

- OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes

- OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app
